# Getting started

To get yourself started, you can directly learn the Deepwave fundamentals from their [documentations](https://ausargeo.com/deepwave/).

To install the environment, run the following command:
```
sh install_env.sh
```
It will take some time, but if, in the end, you see the word `Done!` on your terminal, you are ready to go. 

Remember to always activate the environment by typing:
```
conda activate erse328asi
```
